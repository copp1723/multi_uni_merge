# Multi-Uni-Merge Fix Progress

## Issue 1: MailgunService Abstract Method (RESOLVED ✅)
- ❌ MailgunService class inherits from BaseService but doesn't implement the required abstract method `_health_check`
- ✅ FIXED: Added async _health_check method and proper BaseService initialization

## Issue 2: SwarmOrchestrator Parameter Mismatch (CURRENT)
- ❌ SwarmOrchestrator.__init__() got unexpected keyword argument 'openrouter_service'
- SwarmOrchestrator constructor expects no parameters: `def __init__(self):`
- main.py is trying to pass services as keyword arguments

## Tasks
- [x] Clone repository and examine codebase
- [x] Identify the abstract method issue in MailgunService
- [x] Implement the missing `_health_check` method in MailgunService
- [x] Test the fix locally
- [x] Commit changes with descriptive message
- [x] Push changes to GitHub repository
- [x] Identify SwarmOrchestrator parameter mismatch issue
- [x] Fix SwarmOrchestrator instantiation in main.py
- [x] Test the updated fix
- [ ] Commit and push the SwarmOrchestrator fix

## Analysis
- SwarmOrchestrator constructor takes no parameters but main.py passes 4 service arguments
- Need to remove the service arguments from SwarmOrchestrator instantiation
- Services are already registered in service_registry, so orchestrator can access them from there

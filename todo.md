# Multi-Uni-Merge Fix Progress

## Issue
- ❌ MailgunService class inherits from BaseService but doesn't implement the required abstract method `_health_check`
- This causes "Can't instantiate abstract class MailgunService with abstract method _health_check" error

## Tasks
- [x] Clone repository and examine codebase
- [x] Identify the abstract method issue in MailgunService
- [x] Implement the missing `_health_check` method in MailgunService
- [ ] Test the fix locally
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive message
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub repository

## Analysis
- BaseService class defines abstract method `async def _health_check(self) -> ServiceHealth`
- MailgunService inherits from BaseService but doesn't implement this method
- Need to add async _health_check method that returns ServiceHealth object
- Should leverage existing test_connection() method for health check logic
